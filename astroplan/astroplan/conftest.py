"""
This file contains functions that configure py.test like astropy but with
additions for astroplan.  Py.test looks for specially-named functions
(like  ``pytest_configure``) and uses those to configure itself.

Here, we want to keep the behavior of astropy while *adding* more for astroplan.
To do that, in the functions below, we first invoke the functions from astropy,
and then after that do things specific to astroplan.  But we also want astropy
functionality for any functions we have *not* overriden, so that's why the
``import *`` happens at the top.
