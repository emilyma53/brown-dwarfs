**astroplan** is an open source (BSD licensed) observation planning package for
astronomers that can help you plan for everything but the clouds.

It is an in-development `Astropy <http://www.astropy.org>`__
`affiliated package <http://www.astropy.org/affiliated/index.html>`__ that
seeks to make your life as an observational astronomer a little less
infuriating.
