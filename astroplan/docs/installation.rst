Installation

Requirements
============

**astroplan** works on Linux, Mac OS X and Windows.
It requires Python 2.7 or 3.5+ (2.6 and 3.2 or earlier are not
supported, 3.3 and 3.4 may work) as well as the following packages:

* `Numpy`_ (1.10 or later)
* `Astropy`_ (v1.3 or later)
* `pytz`_

Optional packages:

* `Matplotlib`_
* `astroquery`_

For testing:

* `pytest-astropy`_

First-time Python users may want to consider an all-in-one Python installation
package, such as the `Anaconda Python Distribution
<http://continuum.io/downloads>`_ which provides all of the above dependencies.

Installation
============

You can install the stable version of astroplan from PyPI with::

    pip install astroplan

or from anaconda::

    conda install -c astropy astroplan

Alternatively, you can install the latest developer version of astroplan by
cloning the git repository::

    git clone https://github.com/astropy/astroplan

...then installing the package with::

    cd astroplan
    python setup.py install

Testing
=======

If you want to check that all the tests are running correctly with your Python
configuration, start up python, and type::

    import astroplan
    astroplan.test()

If there are no errors, you are good to go!

.. note::
	If you want to run the tests that access the internet, you'll need to
	replace the last line above with ``astroplan.test(remote_data=True)`` and
	have an active connection to the internet.  Also, if you want the tests
	that check plotting to work, you need `Matplotlib`_ and `pytest-mpl`_.

More
====

astroplan follows `Astropy`_'s guidelines for affiliated packages--installation
and testing for the two are quite similar! Please see Astropy's
`installation page <http://astropy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html>`_
for more information.
