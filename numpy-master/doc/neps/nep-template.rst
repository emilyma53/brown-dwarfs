Abstract
--------

The abstract should be a short description of what the NEP will achieve.

Note that the — in the title is an elongated dash, not -.

Motivation and Scope
--------------------

This section describes the need for the proposed change. It should describe
the existing problem, who it affects, what it is trying to solve, and why.
This section should explicitly address the scope of and key requirements for
the proposed change.


Detailed description
--------------------

This section should provide a detailed description of the proposed change.
It should include examples of how the new functionality would be used,
intended use-cases and pseudo-code illustrating its use.


Related Work
------------

This section should list relevant and/or similar technologies, possibly in other
libraries. It does not need to be comprehensive, just list the major examples of
prior and relevant art.


Implementation
--------------

This section lists the major steps required to implement the NEP.  Where
possible, it should be noted where one step is dependent on another, and which
steps may be optionally omitted.  Where it makes sense, each step should
include a link to related pull requests as the implementation progresses.

Any pull requests or development branches containing work on this NEP should
be linked to from here.  (A NEP does not need to be implemented in a single
pull request if it makes sense to implement it in discrete phases).


Backward compatibility
----------------------

This section describes the ways in which the NEP breaks backward compatibility.


Alternatives
------------

If there were any alternative solutions to solving the same problem, they should
be discussed here, along with a justification for the chosen approach.


Discussion
----------

This section may just be a bullet list including links to any discussions
regarding the NEP:

- This includes links to mailing list threads or relevant GitHub issues.
